# Link of Trust: Discover Like-Minded People Through Your Real Connections

**Link of Trust** is an online tool that helps you find and connect with people you **actually want** to meet, because it’s built on the trust you already have in real life.  

No spammy friend suggestions or endless feeds here—just a simple way to see how your friends (and your friends’ friends) might introduce you to new folks who share your hobbies, passions, or goals.

## 1. Connect Through Real-Life Trust

1. **Start With People You Already Know**  
   When you sign in, you can “trust” friends you genuinely know in person. These connections become your first layer of the network.

2. **See Their Trusted People**  
   - If your friend also trusts someone else, you can peek into that connection.  
   - Maybe you share an interest in art, music, or sports with that friend-of-a-friend!

3. **Ask for an Introduction**  
   - If you discover someone interesting in your extended network, you can ask your mutual friend for an introduction.  
   - No more waiting for an algorithm to guess what you might like—*you* create your own path, based on relationships that already exist in your life.

## 2. Why Use Link of Trust?

1. **No Random Strangers in Your Feed**  
   You only see the people your trusted friends trust (and so on). This keeps conversations authentic and significantly reduces spam.

2. **Find Hidden Common Ground**  
   Without Link of Trust, you might never realize that your friend’s friend also collects rare vinyl records or works in the same field you do. Now, you can discover these valuable connections naturally.

3. **User-Owned, Noise-Free**  
   There’s no big corporation using an algorithm to push ads or top-10 lists. You decide who appears in your network and how far you want to explore.

## 3. Simple How-To Guide

1. **Connect Your Wallet**  
   - Go to [linkoftrust.org](https://linkoftrust.org) and connect your wallet (currently Meteor Wallet is supported).  
   - This simply verifies your identity in a secure way—no new password or big tech account needed.

2. **View Your “Node”**  
   - You’ll see a visual representation of *you* (a node) and the people you trust.  
   - Click on a friend’s node to explore who *they* trust in turn.

3. **Search by Username**  
   - Already know someone’s username? Type it in to see if they’re on Link of Trust.  
   - From there, branch out to their trusted network and explore further.

4. **Create or Update Your Profile**  
   - Add a short public description: your interests, skills, or anything else you’d like to share.  
   - This helps others confirm it’s really you—and see if you share a passion they’d love to chat about.

5. **Request Introductions**  
   - Found someone intriguing two or three connections away?  
   - Ask your mutual friend offline (or however you like) to introduce you.  
   - There’s no direct messaging on Link of Trust, so everything happens with consent through existing real-life ties.

## 4. Real Examples

1. **Shared Passions**

   - You might never have guessed you had this mutual interest if you hadn’t seen that trust link.

2. **Local Community Building**  
   - In a new city? Trust your nearby acquaintances, see who they’re connected to, and quickly learn about local communities or events.

3. **Professional Networking**  
   - Instead of cold emails or random LinkedIn requests, you can see *exactly* who a trusted colleague might know, so you can politely ask for an intro.
